# Project Title
Two-Factor Authentication for Magento 2 Admin Login

## Getting Started

Magento 2 Two-Factor Authentication will protect our store from insecure Internet connections (wifi, mobile), key loggers, and more.

Every time we login into your Web site there is a chance that someone is sniffing or logging the password, which can later be used to login to your store and wreak havoc.

We can protect our store from these attacks by using our advanced Magento Two-Factor Authentication, which uses Google authenticator and your smart phone in order to authenticate your admin session.

### Prerequisites
[Google Authenticator App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en)

## Fun Demo
It authenticates only Admin Login however there is a frontend demo as well.

{Magento Store URL}/authenticator
